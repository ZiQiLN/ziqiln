Bored Software Enginner with like 2-3 years of experience in building crap in
JavaScript and TypeScript, explored pretty much JavaScript-related technologies
such as `electron`, `react`, `node` and `deno`. In free time I love to deal with
biohacking things combined with neuroscience, almost in same leval as donating
my savings to wallstreet on stock exchange.
