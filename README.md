Jay's pile of ssh.it
====================

*This profile contains mostly old repositories of mine when I was learning, some worthless experiments that I had have throwed to trashbin.*

Passionate software engineer who is connecting all of the
domains of personal life into one place, thinking and
thinkering software and tools to empower ones life in a
pragmatic and ergonomic manner.

**Recently closed research projects**:

- [`20240826_UMAPB`](https://github.com/keinsell/20240826-using-main-as-production-branch), Experiment or rather practice of treating default branch as production release which touch user and unlearning practice of "leaving things for later" as it never works and usually lead to things like [`20231101-kitchen-sink-on-crack-engineering`](https://github.com/keinsell/20231101-kitchen-sink-on-crack-engineering)
- [`20240401_CIDW`](https://github.com/keinsell/20240401-continous-integration-dummy-workflow), Implementation of AWS Reference Architecture for CI/CD Pipelines with Github Actions (dummy-jobs without functionality).

- [`20231101_KSOCE`](https://github.com/keinsell/20231101-kitchen-sink-on-crack-engineering), It's a perfect reason why manic episodes aren't good for your health, I have no clue what was the goal of this project but journey was likie hike on mountains but collecting every stone that you will see on road to see how much you can put in your backpack. Usually I would use external library for sh.it but my inner autist got into rewriting half of the ecosystem to see how things are glueing together.
