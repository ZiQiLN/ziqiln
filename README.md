Bored Software Enginner with like 2-3 years of experience in building crap in
JavaScript and TypeScript, explored pretty much JavaScript-related technologies
such as `electron`, `react`, `node` and `deno`. In free time I love to deal with
biohacking things combined with neuroscience, almost in same leval as donating
my savings to wallstreet on stock exchange.

- By 2022, I'm planning to release my own blog and application which have on mind introduce people to harm-reduction practices for doing drugs aned ocassionally add some features related for nootropics (as discussed on r/nootropics).
