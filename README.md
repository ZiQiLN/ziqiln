### Jay Whitewood

21 years old Software Developer with passion to inefficient…? things. My journey in this world was pretty funny starting from 2017 where I was starting with UI/UX and Day-Trading. Up to this day I’m associated with a lot of things such as IT, Finances and Chemistry (for “research” purpose ofc). Actually I’m researching an P2P-based technology and thinking about [Araclx, Inc](https://github.com/araclx) which can potentially fill my ego and verify my manifest of software development. Ya’ll can contact me about different things.
