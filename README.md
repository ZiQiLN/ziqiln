### Jay "Keinsell" Whitewood

People who actually knows me personally know that I'm a quite degenerated Software Enginner (Node.js) and Investor. In my free time I'm trying to contribute to much things such as open-source (not at all, just wrtiting my useless stuff) and (that's wierd one) Psychonautwiki. In a little part of my life I was researching botany, drugs and research-chemicals in order to biohacking - still have a lot of research to do and publish it.
