> Refer to me as Jay that's way more simple.

20 years old Software Developer and Autistic Day Trader who has started his journey to milion bucks on bank account at 2015, by building Minecraft servers on contracts (weird flex but okay). In present Jay is hustling around experimenting with latest technologies to build software that doesn't suck at all implementing massive amounts of (useless and not necessary) P2P-based Technology. Founded [Araclx, Inc]() in 2020 in purose to waste a little more time on developing world's first degenerate-centric software.

Quite a lot of bastards called me toxic on job interviews, which is obiviously true because dealing with idiots who act as better people only because they have higher position in company is quite sad for me, just don't waste my time by asking me about closures - I was doing software, I'm doing that and probably I'll be doing this shit for next 20 years so I don't give a sigle fuck about somebody's opinion on that I have no clue what closures are, you dumbasses.
